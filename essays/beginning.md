## How did I end up in IT?

I have a BS degree in Nuclear Engineering. No, that is not why I started losing my hair... that is a longer story. After serving on a nuclear submarine and as a Naval Intelligence Officer, I realized I needed to change career fields to one that had jobs in places I actually wanted to live and also be something that could, if I wanted it, be my "last" career. And I wanted to make a decent living. After doing some research, and while still on active duty, I earned my MS in Information Systems to help me transition to a civilian career in IT. For better or worse, I have been doing IT and cybersecurity related jobs for 20+ years.
